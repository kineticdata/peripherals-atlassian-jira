=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Jira Rest API library to retrieve an issue
from a Jira project. The handler takes a issue key and and then
retrieves information about that issue in JSON form. The handler
then converts that JSON into XML that the handler can return to the 
task engine. (WARNING: Using this handler without enabling SSL will 
not be secure). Any errors that occur during the process will be caught 
and re-raised by this handler.
