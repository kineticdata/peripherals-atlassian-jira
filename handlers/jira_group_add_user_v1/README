=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Jira Rest API library to add a user to an 
existing group within Jira. The handler first puts the data that 
was inputted into the JSON format and then posts that information 
using a REST call with basic auth. (WARNING: Using this handler 
without enabling SSL will not be secure). Any errors that occur 
during the process will be caught and re-raised by this handler. 
Because there is no return values, if there are no errors raised 
by the handler the user has been added successfully.
