== Jira_Group_Create
This handler creates a new group in Jira.

  The name of the new group.

=== Results
No results are returned from this handler

==== Sample Configuration
Group Name:                   Test Group 1

=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Jira Rest API library to create a group
within Jira. The handler first puts the data that was inputted into 
the JSON format and then posts that information using a REST call 
with basic auth. (WARNING: Using this handler without enabling SSL 
will not be secure). Any errors that occur during the process will 
be caught and re-raised by this handler. Because there is no return,
if there are no errors raised by the handler the group has been 
created successfully.
