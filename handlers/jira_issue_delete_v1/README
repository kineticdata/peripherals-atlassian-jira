==== Sample Configuration

=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Jira Rest API library to delete an issue in 
Jira. The handler first puts the data that was inputted into 
the JSON format and then posts that information using a REST call 
with basic auth. (WARNING: Using this handler without enabling SSL 
will not be secure). Any errors that occur during the process will 
be caught and re-raised by this handler. Because there is no return,
if there are no errors raised by the handler the issue has been 
deleted successfully.
