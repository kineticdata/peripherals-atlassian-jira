=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Jira Rest API library to upload a file to an existing Jira
issue. The handler first faciliates the upload through Remedy, then sends the 
file to Jira in a REST call, and then finishes by deleting the copy of the file
from the specified Remedy server (since it the data will have already been sent
to Jira). WARNING: Using this handler without enabling SSL will not be secure
within a Jira project. Any errors that occur during the process will be caught 
and re-raised by this handler.
