=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Jira Rest API library to create a new user
in Jira. The handler first puts the data that was inputted into 
the JSON format and then posts that information using a REST call 
with basic auth. (WARNING: Using this handler without enabling SSL 
will not be secure). The key of the newly created user will be 
returned by the handler. Any errors that occur during the process 
will be caught and re-raised by this handler.
